/**
 * @brief The RGB_LED_Output function sets the output of the RGB LED.
 *
 * This function sets the output of the RGB LED based on the value of the input, led_value.
 * A bitwise AND operation (& 0xF1) is performed to mask the Bits 1 to 3 of the GPIOF's DATA register
 * to preserve the state of other pins connected to Port F while keeping the RGB LED pins unaffected.
 * Then, a bitwise OR operation is performed with led_value to set the RGB LED pins to the desired state
 * specified by led_value.
 *
 * @param led_value An 8-bit unsigned integer that determines the output of the RGB LED. To turn off
 *                  the RGB LED, set led_value to 0. The following values determine the color of the RGB LED:
 *
 *  Color       LED(s)   led_value
 *  Off         ---         0x00
 *  Red         R--         0x02
